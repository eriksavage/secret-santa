## About
A single page secret santa web application. This app was intially developed as a [replit project](https://replit.com/@eriksavage/SavageSecretSanta#src/App.css) to match a hard coded list of participants.

My goal with this project is to import the functionality of the replit project and expand upon it with the [feature road map](#feature-road-map) below, utlimately deploying with github pages.

The replit app got the job done for 2022, would like this to be polished for the next holiday season.
